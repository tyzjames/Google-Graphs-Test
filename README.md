Testing out various graphing libraries

<b>ItemPriceIndex</b> </br>
I took the prices for a number of items over time and indexed them to a single item. 
The items are then plotted using Google Graphs. Their x,y coordinates are generated using the formulas: </br>
x = sqrt(b^2 + c^2) x sin(pi/180 x quadrantAngle) </br>
y = sqrt(b^2 + c^2) x cos(pi/180 x quadrantAngle) </br>

The purpose is to show on a graph how the items prices move in relation to one another over time.
